            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny’s worth.
            <p>
              “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
              been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had
            </p>
            an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
            and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
            12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did
      the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their
      experiences was easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress
      which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary
      to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
      developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
      attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly

          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
    code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
    programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
    theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
    curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never
    had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
    outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
    could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
    example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
    full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
